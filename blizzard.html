        <h2>Why are you interested in working with Blizzard?</h2>
        <p class="lead">I am interested in working with Blizzard because I am passionate about software and video games. It takes true passion<br>
        	to make great games and making something that changes people's lives is what motivates me to always give 110%. Not many people believe <br>
        	video games have the power to change people but I don't think I have to convince you guys of the opposite. </p>

        <h2>What is the biggest reason projects fail?</h2> 
        <p class="lead">The biggest reason projects fail is poor planning ahead of time and poor adjustments along the way. <br>
        	I have years of experience in breaking down projects and scoping costs before a projects starts to ensure<br>
        	 it's technically and financially possible. I also have extensive experience in nurturing software through its lifecycle - no <br>
        	 plan is perfect so you need someone with a keen eye to manage and adjust to moving targets while ensuring quality remains a top priority.</p>

        <h2>What is the biggest challenge facing the adoption of a Release Management Organization?</h2>
        <p class="lead">The biggest challege(s) facing adoption of Release management are: entrenched beliefs about how the process should work and a <br>
        	false bias about "what's best for the customer". Speaking about the first, many people have an entrenched belief that software has to be delievered <br>
        	in a certain, chaotic fashion. As process managers, we have to work hard to dispel that belief through positive reinforcement. Showing how to handle a burning issue <br>
        	within the frameworks of a safe and reliable process is key to winning developers over - not having to stay late to fix bugs because the release is stable is usually a powerful incentive. Secondly, <br>
  			many people believe that doing what's best for the customer is synonymous with chaos and last minute fixes. Often, the opposite is true since carelessness leads to bugs <br>
  			and bad user experiences. Instead, positive experiences within a robust process that ensures quality and proper regression testing/budgeting is the recipie for success</p>

        <h2>What Products did you lead from a Release management perspective?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Both with Cvent and Akamai, I own and manage the entire tech stack release schedule. Whether it's rolling out new software for Akamai CDN, doing a release across <br>
        	the dozens of apps at Cvent or coordinating a Java patch off-hours, it all fell on my shoulders for the entire suite of product offerings.  Please refer to <a href="https://www.akamai.com"> Akamai.com </a>or <br>
        	<a href="http://www.cvent.com/en/hospitality-cloud/hotels/group-demand-management/passkey.shtml">Cvent.com</a> for a full description of the products I have experience delivering</p>
   		<div class="col-md-6">
        <h2>What is the difference between Management and Leadership?</h2>
        <p class="lead">The easiest way to spot a bad leader is to ask them this question. A good manager is organized, detail oriented and is often <br> 
        	firefighting to meet a deadline. A good leader has all of those qualities but can inspire those around him/her to be their best. Instead of nagging <br> 
        	people why they should follow a certain process, a good leader listens to people's concerns and actively molds themselves and the process to address those needs. As a leader, your job <br>
        	is to simply empower your employees and get out of their way, while subtly course correcting along the way. A good manager can effectively manage a team of 5-10 people <br>
        	to meet deadlines and work hard. A good leader can do that for hundrends.</p>
